## Ingredients

- 4 large zucchini
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup cooked brown rice
- 1 cup salsa (use your preferred level of spiciness)
- 1 red bell pepper, cored and diced
- 1/2 red onion, diced
- 1/2 cup corn kernels
- 1 jalapeno (or poblano pepper), cored and diced
- 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 2 teaspoons cumin
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped
- salt to taste
- 1 cup shredded cheddar/monterey jack cheese

## Directions

1. Start by greasing a 9 x 13” casserole dish and set aside. Slice each zucchini in half lengthwise. Using a melon baller or metal teaspoon, hollow out the center of each zucchini. Lightly brush the tops with one teaspoon of olive oil then place them skin side down in the casserole dish.

2. Next warm the tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and the peppers and cook for 2-3 minutes. Then add the rice, corn, beans, salsa, chili powder and cumin. Stir everything together and continue to cook for about 5 minutes and remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.

3. Preheat the oven to 400°F and stir in 1/4 cup of the cilantro and salt to taste to the filling. Spoon the filling inside of each zucchini until they are all full. Sprinkle each one with cheese then arrange them in the dish and cover with foil. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes and then remove the foil and set the oven to broil. Cook them for 5 more minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.

4. Allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes, top with fresh cilantro, and serve. Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
